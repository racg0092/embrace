# EMBRACE

## Description
`Embrace` is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that provides assistance and automation for software developers. The goal is to provide complex scaffolding for projects so that repetetive tasks and snippets of codes are automatically done or generated for you.

## Installation
In the future we plan to publish this as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package so it will be easy to downlad and install. There are also plans to implement [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) to have the user run builds and scripts without the need to isntal the binaries locally.

As of now you will need to clone this repo and build the package your self if you want to use `Embrace`.

`Prerequisites`
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
- [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)

`Embrace` is a build using python3 so you will need [Python3](https://www.python.org/) if you want to run the script locally without having to build the binaries. First verify that you have python installed in your system if you don't refer to the website to download and install.

`How to verify?`
