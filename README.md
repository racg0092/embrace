# EMBRACE

## Description
`Embrace` is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that provides assistance and automation for software developers. The goal is to provide complex scaffolding for porjects so that repetetive task and snippets of codes are automatically done for you.

## Installation
In the future we plan to publish this as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package so it will be easy to downlad and install. There are also plans to implement [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) to have the user run builds and scripts without the need to isntal the binaries locally.

As of now you will need to clone this repo and build the package your self if you want to use `Embrace`.
